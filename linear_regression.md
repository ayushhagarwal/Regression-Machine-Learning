# Regression-Machine-Learning
Here you can see a collection of different machine learning projects ranging from simple to few complicated ones.

The first one is a simple linear regression model. 
## The problem statement for the model is-
We have a datset which has two columns, one with the years of experience of employee and what is the salary of that person.
Suppose you are starting a new company and you need to recruit people and the above dataset are the shortlisted candidates.
Now we need to find out what is the correlation between salary and years of experience.
Also create model which will tell what is the best fitting line of this relationship.
Also if the company doesn't know how to set a salary for new employee use this data to set the salary of the employee.

The dataset and the respective model is uploaded.
